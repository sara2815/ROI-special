    fullMessage: "I'm assuming you've opened this because you're craving some chai. However, knowing you, this could be anytime from 6 am to 2 am, and it could be anywhere from your first to your third cup of the day. Im pretty sure if i dissected you, I would find chai.\n\ \n\
    When I think of chai, it takes me back to our UST days where I would heap sugar into my drink to share this with you. The words 'I like you' were buried deep inside, the words 'I hate chai' were stuffed under covers, and the words 'I like spending time with you' were at my lips but never quite said. But chai was slow, and snacks could be added to prolong the duration, and our conversation could be taken off in tangents to ask for a minute longer without really asking for it.\n\ \n\ The sweetness of the lingering, in retrospect, puts forth heavy competition to to the sugar I added to my cup. Now, here we are. The words are out in the open, and hundreds of thousands of miles take the space of the distance of a single LG1 table. Funny how that works.\n\
   I imagine it to be a rainy day or a dark evening as you drink you chai. I wonder if you put ginger in yours, or if you cook it like a lazy man's milk tea. If i was there, I'd force my cups of tea at you: peppermint, jasmine, orange pekoe, and raspberry leaf. I can already imagine you crinkling your nose at this. Nevertheless, I hope your drink is warm, I hope time passes slowly and gently, and I hope you take a moment to enjoy it all.",

    fullMessage: "Maybe we've clashed the way that two headstrong people inevitably will. Maybe your 'we must take it out' self was forced to deal with my 'i dont want to talk about' self. Most likely, I've been a menace. But nevertheless, we're both a bit hurt, or mad, or stubborn, or some permutation combination of it.\n\ \n\
    S once said that a ldr was hard because, what could be fixed with a hug and a few words face to face, could take hours of conversation. For better or worse, that's the deal we both have signed up for. Disagreements are bound to take a little more work this way, but I'm sure we've got it. We're both SO COOL after all. \n\ \n\
    As I write this, the day is warm and sunny and I cannot imagine ever being mad at you. I've shared your donuts with my coworkers today, I've shyly talked about you, I've smiled countless times at your email and I've been so so happy (very giggly too). I hope it's this nice for you too. I really want to be able to make it so. That's the goal here after all right?\n\ \n\
    So, sure sometimes things will be sucky, and we won't get it right. But we both know we wouldn't be here unless we really wanted it, and while occasionally we (mostly I) will make our mistakes, we can only really keep an eye out for the larger picture. All I can ask for is some patience. I love you very much! And know that we will fix it in a few hours at max (allows for one meal cycle HAHA)",

    fullMessage: "This is for one of those days where everything does not feel in the grasp of your find, everything is a bit frustrating, and your brain wonders if you can even do all the things you want to (I'm sorry if this is presumptuous, this is just me so often HAHA, maybe you're too cool to be plagued by these things.). \n\n\
 Either ways, you are hands down the coolest, smartest person I know. And before you accuse me of being rose tinted, I'd like you to know my opinions are based in objective facts. Ever since the day you sat in my class and I saw you work on your blood donation service thing, to the first time I read your writing, to every person who I met, who only ever had great things to say about you, down to the way you think. I don't think you realize or appreciate just how cool and capable you are. \n\
You're smart, you're the most hardworking person I know, you're kind and you're idealistic, and you're just such a unique person.\n\n\
I know that you often joke that the vast amount of good things that have come your way, are undeserved, but I hope deep down you know that is not true. You're the kind that juggles three jobs at all times, supports others, helps his family, shoulders responsibilities, handles my tantrums, reads, thinks, actively questions things around him, and pursues cool new things that come your way. So sure, once in a while, things may not go your way immediately, or it may feel like it won't.\n\n\
You're built for great things (I ensure I always get a good ROI you know) and I hope you can see it, just as clearly everyone who knows you can see it.",

    fullMessage: "If you’re opening this, I’m guessing it’s been a long day. The type where everything feels heavy and you really need a NAP (this is a threat to ensure you're sleeping soon). I see unfortunately that you find yourself in this state a bit too often. \n\n\
    So before anything else, I want you to pause for a second. Take a deep breath in. Close your eyes for a few seconds. And then answer my very important questions: \n\n\
    Have you eaten properly?\n\
    Drank some water?\n\
    Sat down without looking at a screen or thinking about things you have to do? \n\ \n\
    I know how you are. You’ll push through exhaustion like it’s a personality trait. You’ll show up for everyone, finish what needs to be finished, do things quietly without making a fuss, check in on your loved ones.  And while that’s one of the things I admire most about you, it also means you quite often forget that you’re human too. \n\\n\
You’re allowed to take breaks!!! Infact you need them. You need to dilly dally. You need to laze around. These are just as important as working hard, and achieveing things, even if it doesn't seem so.\n\n\
Go do something small that brings you joy. Lie down for a bit. Listen to music. Sleep in. Rest, but PROPERLY.\n\n\
Because at the end of the day, when the noise fades and you log off work and your responsibilities are done, and the world slows down, you are the one person you will always have. So take care of yourself with the same gentleness you give everyone else. Your laptop sticker says: no act of kindness is ever wasted: apply that to yourself. You deserve that care too. Consider that a command.",

I wish I could sit across from you and hear every small detail: you better call me to tell me anyways. You don't always give yourself enough credit, and you need to celebrate, and be celebrated more. I hope you’re taking a second to actually let yourself feel it. You’re so used to moving onto the next task, the next responsibility, the next one of your 3 jobs HAHAH. But days like this deserve to be paused in. Linger in it a little. Replay the good parts. Let it sink in that you’re so so cool and that you deserve amazing things, and that you should always be smiling. \n\ \n\
Also I’m really proud of you! If I was there, we’d celebrate in some small way (MORE SNACKS TO TRY PROBABLY). But since I’m not, let me know, let me talk to you, let me get you a fun treat, and let me be part of it.\n\ \n\
Keep Smiling!!!",
